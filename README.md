## Project Overview
This project is a console-based University Inventory Management System developed in Java.
It allows university staff to manage equipment, assign assets to staff members, track
availability, and generate inventory reports.

The system simulates real-world university asset management using object-oriented
programming principles.

## Key Features
- Add and manage equipment inventory
- Register staff members
- Assign and return equipment
- Calculate maintenance and utilisation statistics
- Generate inventory and assignment reports
- Menu-driven console interface
- Custom exception handling for invalid operations

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Eclipse IDE
- GitHub for version control

## Concepts Demonstrated
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Inheritance and Polymorphism
- Abstract classes
- Custom exception handling
- Arrays and data storage
- Decision structures (if/else, switch)
- Loops (for, while, do-while, foreach)
- Menu-driven console applications

## Challenges & Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I improved my understanding of Java OOP concepts,
exception handling, and how real-world systems manage structured data.
I also gained confidence in designing larger programs and organising code
using proper package structures.
